# Configuration

Tile reads `%APPDATA%\Tile\config.yml`, or `config.yaml` if that is the one there (`tilectl
config` prints the path). Tile runs on its built-in defaults, so the file only needs the settings
you want to change. On first run it creates `config.yml` holding just `tray`, the tray's
switches, which Tile saves there whenever you change them. Add a section and key to change
anything else; the [default config](#the-default-config) below lists them all to copy from. Saved changes apply immediately,
and `tilectl check [file]` reports what is wrong with a config. A bad config is not applied; the
previous one is kept, and the tray icon turns red until the file is fixed (see
[the tray](windows-integration.md#the-tray)).

Whole configs to start from are in [`examples/`](../examples): `default.yml` is the defaults
written out in full, every bind included (with `default_binds: false`), and `mbwilding.yml` is
the author's own Dvorak setup with home-row mods.

These sections **replace** the built-in set entirely when you write them, so copy the defaults
from the end of this page as a starting point:

- `rules`
- `remap.layers`

`binds` add to the [default binds](keybinds.md#default-keys) instead (see [`binds`](#binds)).
Every other section merges: a key you leave out keeps its default. Unknown keys are an error.

YAML needs quotes around a key or value that starts with punctuation (`"#89b4fa"`, `"/"`, `"!"`)
or contains `: ` or ` #`, and around numbers meant as text (`"2"`).

## Reference

### `general`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tiling` | `true` | Manage windows. `false` leaves them alone and gives Win+L back; turning it on again manages the open windows. |
| `default_binds` | `true` | Start from the [default binds](keybinds.md#default-keys), which `binds` add to. `false` leaves only your own `binds`. |
| `remap` | `true` | Run the key remapper with the `remap` layers. |
| `gaps_in` | `10` | Pixels between neighbouring tiled windows. |
| `gaps_out` | `10` | Pixels between tiled windows and the monitor edge. |
| `independent_workspaces` | `true` | Every monitor has workspaces of its own, so `workspace 2` is workspace 2 on the monitor you are on and never moves focus to another monitor. `false` syncs the monitors: switching workspace switches them all together. See [layouts](layouts.md#workspaces-and-monitors). |
| `layout` | `master` | Layout of new workspaces: `dwindle`, `master`, `monocle`, `scrolling` or `even`. New workspaces on a portrait monitor start with `even` instead. See [layouts](layouts.md). |
| `borders` | `true` | Colour the window border to show focus (Windows 11). |
| `border_active` | `theme.accent` | Border colour of the focused window. |
| `border_inactive` | `theme.inactive` | Border colour of every other tiled window. |
| `focus_new_windows` | `true` | Focus a window when it opens. |
| `decorations` | `false` | Keep title bars on tiled windows. Floating windows always keep theirs; a rule can override this per app. |
| `override_win_l` | `true` | Take over Win+L so it can be bound. See [Windows integration](windows-integration.md). |
| `disable_click_to_do` | `true` | Switch off Click to Do, whose glow shows whenever Win is held (Copilot+ PCs). |
| `disable_start_menu` | `false` | Releasing Win on its own doesn't open the Start menu. Win combos and binds are unaffected. See [Windows integration](windows-integration.md). |

### `theme`

The font, corners and colours shared by everything Tile draws: the focus borders, the
[launcher](launcher.md) and the [workspace indicator](#workspace_indicator). Change them here to
restyle everything at once. Each of those sections has its own keys for the same things, unset
by default; set one there to override the theme for just that part.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `font` | `Segoe UI` | Font family. |
| `corners` | `round` | Window corners: `round`, `small` or `square` (Windows 11). |
| `background` | `"#1e1e2e"` | The launcher's window. |
| `foreground` | `"#cdd6f4"` | Text. |
| `dimmed` | `"#7f849c"` | Secondary text: the launcher's app ids and placeholder. |
| `accent` | `"#89b4fa"` | The focused window's border, the launcher's outline, caret and selected row, and the workspace indicator. |
| `accent_foreground` | `"#1e1e2e"` | Text on `accent`: the launcher's selected row and the workspace number. |
| `inactive` | `"#45475a"` | The border of tiled windows without focus. |

### `tray`

The tray menu's switches. Tile writes these itself when you change one, and reads them at
startup, so you rarely need to edit them.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tile` | `true` | The window manager is on (the tray's Tile item). |
| `remap` | `false` | The key remapper is on (the tray's Remap item). Off until switched on. |
| `shell` | `false` | Tile is the shell (the tray's Shell item): it hosts the notification area when no taskbar is running, keeps the launcher bound (to `Win+R`, or `Win+D` if that is taken, when you haven't bound it) and shows the tray icons in a row of their own at its top. See [shell mode](shell.md). Turning it on also makes Tile your sign-in shell in place of Explorer from the next sign-in, and Tile keeps that in step with the file: a config with `shell: true` sets it up the first time Tile runs, and editing it back puts Explorer back. Tile started with `--shell`, which that sign-in shell uses, is the shell whatever this says. |
| `log` | `false` | Log to the log file (the tray's Log item). |

These are separate from `general.tiling` and `general.remap`, which switch the features off
entirely: a feature runs only when both its `general` setting and its tray switch are on.

### `shell`

Tile as the Windows shell, in place of Explorer's taskbar. See [shell mode](shell.md). Whether
Tile is the shell is the tray's Shell switch, [`tray.shell`](#tray).

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_startup` | `true` | When Tile starts as the shell, run the `Run` and `RunOnce` registry keys and the Startup folders, as Explorer would. |

### `cursor`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `warp` | `true` | Whenever a keybind or dispatch moves focus, put the pointer on the focused window (the monitor's centre if it is empty), unless it is already over it. The pointer is then hidden, as typing hides it (needs `hide_on_key`), until the mouse moves. |
| `hide_on_key` | `true` | Hide the pointer while typing, until the mouse moves or clicks. Modifiers on their own and keybinds don't count as typing. |
| `drag` | `true` | Hold Win and drag a window with the left button, from anywhere on it. On release the window is re-tiled where it is dropped. |

### `animations`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Ease windows into place. |
| `duration_ms` | `180` | Length of a move or resize. |
| `bezier` | `[0.0, 0.75, 0.15, 1.0]` | Cubic-bezier control points `x1, y1, x2, y2`. |

### Layout sections

| Section | Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dwindle` | `split_ratio` | `0.5` | Share of a split given to the existing window. |
| `master` | `mfact` | `0.5` | Width of the master area, as a share of the monitor. |
| `master` | `count` | `1` | Windows in the master area. |
| `master` | `new_is_master` | `false` | New windows become the master. |
| `scrolling` | `proportion` | `0.333` | Width of new columns, as a share of the monitor. |
| `scrolling` | `proportion_presets` | `[0.25, 0.333, 0.5, 1.0]` | Widths `cycleproportion` steps through. |
| `scrolling` | `center_focused` | `on_overflow` | When to centre the focused column: `always`, `on_overflow` (when it would otherwise be partly off screen) or `never`. |

### `launcher`

The app launcher, opened by the `launcher` dispatcher. See [launcher](launcher.md).

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | `560` | Width in pixels at 100% scaling (scaled with the monitor). |
| `height` | `500` | Height in pixels at 100% scaling. |
| `search_position` | `top` | Where the search box sits: `top` or `bottom`. |
| `show_icons` | `true` | Show each app's icon. |
| `compact` | `false` | Shorter rows, without the app id under the name. |
| `max_results` | `50` | The most apps listed. |
| `track_usage` | `true` | Remember launches in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tile\launcher.json`. |
| `sort_by_usage` | `true` | List recent launches first, and let often launched apps win close matches. |
| `ignore_mouse` | `false` | The mouse doesn't select or launch. |
| `pinned` | `[]` | App names or ids listed first, in this order, before anything is typed. |
| `hide` | `[]` | Regexes (case-insensitive) on the app name or id; matching apps are never listed. |
| `font` | `theme.font` | Font family. |
| `font_size` | `11` | Font size in points. |
| `corners` | `theme.corners` | Window corners: `round`, `small` or `square` (Windows 11). |
| `opacity` | `1.0` | How opaque the whole window is, from `0.1` to `1.0`. |
| `background` | `theme.background` | Window colour. |
| `border` | `theme.accent` | The window's outline (Windows 11). |
| `foreground` | `theme.foreground` | Text colour. |
| `dimmed` | `theme.dimmed` | The app id line and the placeholder. |
| `selected` | `theme.accent` | The selected row and the caret. |
| `selected_foreground` | `theme.accent_foreground` | Text on the selected row. |
| `placeholder` | `""` | Shown in the empty search box; `{prefix}` becomes `command_prefix`. Empty shows `Search apps or equations, ! for commands` with the real prefix, leaving out the calculator or commands when they are off. |
| `calculator` | `true` | Show the value of a search that reads as a calculation first; Enter copies it. See [calculator](launcher.md#calculator). |
| `command_prefix` | `"!"` | Typing this first runs a command line or a Tile dispatcher instead of searching apps. `""` switches it off. See [commands](launcher.md#commands). |
| `system_items` | `true` | List the system items (volume, network, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, battery, clock, power) and tray icons that match what is typed, after the apps. See [system items](launcher.md#system-items-and-tray-icons). |
| `system_prefix` | `"@"` | Typing this first lists every system item and tray icon, narrowed by what follows, even with `system_items` off. `""` switches it off. |
| `bar` | `true` | Show the bar at the top of the launcher: the time (bold, with seconds) and date, and icon buttons for switch user, log out, lock, restart and shut down. See [the bar](launcher.md#the-bar). |

### `workspace_indicator`

A small square showing the workspace number that flashes up on the focused monitor when a
`workspace` or `movetoworkspace` dispatcher runs (even onto the workspace you are already on),
then fades out. It never takes focus and clicks go through it.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Show it. |
| `position` | `bottom_right` | Where it sits on the monitor's work area: `center`, `top`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`, `left` or `right`. |
| `gap` | `48` | Pixels from the edges it sits against, at 100% scaling. Unused for `center`. |
| `size` | `96` | Width and height in pixels at 100% scaling. It widens for a number that doesn't fit. |
| `duration_ms` | `400` | How long it stays fully shown. |
| `fade_ms` | `250` | How long it then takes to fade out. `0` hides it at once. |
| `font` | `theme.font` | Font family of the number. |
| `font_size` | `36` | Font size in points. |
| `bold` | `true` | Bold number. |
| `corners` | `theme.corners` | Corners: `round`, `small` or `square` (Windows 11). |
| `opacity` | `0.95` | How opaque it is when fully shown, from `0.1` to `1.0`. |
| `background` | `theme.accent` | Its colour. |
| `foreground` | `theme.accent_foreground` | The number's colour. |

### `binds`

Keybinds, as `<keys>: <dispatcher>`. They add to the [default binds](keybinds.md#default-keys):
a key that is already bound gets your dispatcher instead, and an empty value (`""` or `~`)
unbinds it. Set `general.default_binds: false` to start from nothing.

```yaml
binds:
  super+t: exec wtd.exe -w new          # replaces the default Win+T
  super+e: focusorexec code.cmd         # focus VS Code, or start it
  super+z: ~                            # unbind the default Win+Z
```

Launching, closing, locking, desktops, `reload`, the `toggle*` dispatchers and `exit` work even with tiling
off or paused; the rest only run while Tile is on (the tray's Tile item). See
[keybinds](keybinds.md) for the key names and every dispatcher.

### `rules`

Per-window overrides. See [window rules](window-rules.md).

### `remap`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modifier_guard` | `true` | A layer's lone Alt or Win press doesn't open a menu or Start. |
| `layers.<name>` | see below | keyd-style layers. See [key remapping](key-remapping.md). |

## The default config

This is the configuration Tile runs with when the file is empty or missing, so it can be copied
as it is. A test checks that this block lists every setting at its real default.
